# Py_Parallel_Wrapper
This is a python script that implements with a naive parallelization with an executable that is passed to it. The number of parallel instances of the program are determined by setting the number of parallel processors that are available through command line arguments. Furthermore, the number of runs of the program must also be specified. If there are more runs than processors the runs will be placed in a pool. 

Some very simple instructions are provided on the wiki:
